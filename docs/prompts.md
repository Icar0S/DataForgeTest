Create a new folder for a chatbot project with llm in the folder "C:\Users\Icaro\OneDrive\Documents\projetos-google-cli", use as a basis for the project structure the public repository as a base: "https://github.com/great-ufc/migration-on-premise-cloud-mapping/tree/main/poc", the idea is that for each open chat we have a sequence of questions answered for the generation of python scripts at the end. Objective: LLM (if you want it can be google-cli) that helps build rules for data quality. Phase 1: checklist of key questions for data validation and cleaning. Phase 2: After a certain number of questions, an intermediate DSL of what the rules are will be generated. Phase 3: The chat analyzes these rules and generates the codes to run on a spark cluster.
